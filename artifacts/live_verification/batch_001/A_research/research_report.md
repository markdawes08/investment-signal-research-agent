## Public grounding

- [Benchmarks as Limits to Arbitrage: Understanding the Low-Volatility Anomaly](https://archive.nyu.edu/handle/2451/29593) (`baker-2010-benchmarks`): The paper examines comparatively weak historical returns among high-volatility and high-beta stocks. It proposes that investor demand for risk and benchmark-relative mandates can limit corrective arbitrage. This motivates comparing total-volatility and beta definitions, while leaving open whether any particular implementation will reproduce the reported pattern.
- [The Cross-Section of Volatility and Expected Returns](https://www.nber.org/papers/w10852) (`ang-2004-volatility`): The authors study aggregate volatility exposure and firm-specific volatility in stock returns. Their evidence links high residual volatility relative to the Fama/French model with lower average returns. Residual volatility is distinct from total return volatility, so this paper motivates a separate candidate rather than directly validating the MVP's total-volatility specification.
- [Portfolios Formed Monthly on Variance](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_port_form_VAR.html) (`french-variance-methodology`): This methodology forms variance-ranked portfolios each month using NYSE breakpoints and lagged daily returns. Its variance window uses 60 days, with at least 20 observations. The MVP's 12-month signal uses synthetic monthly returns and is an explicitly different educational specification. Only the methodology description is indexed; numerical portfolio returns are not included.
- [Description of Fama/French Factors](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_factors.html) (`french-factor-methodology`): The page explains market excess returns and the size and value factors built from stock portfolios. These factors provide context for separating market exposure from residual volatility. A factor-based test would need dated factor observations and an explicit estimation model. This MVP retrieves the description only and neither downloads nor substitutes real factor data.
- [A Backtesting Protocol in the Era of Machine Learning](https://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/G138_A_backtesting_protocol.pdf) (`arnott-2019-protocol`): The authors propose disciplined empirical research to reduce false discoveries in limited financial samples. Economic motivation and a falsifiable hypothesis should precede performance inspection. Repeatedly modifying models after seeing returns can inflate apparent success. The MVP uses this guidance for pre-outcome specification locks and a record of every candidate considered.
- [The Probability of Backtest Overfitting](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4w1110bb/qt4w1110bb.pdf) (`bailey-2017-overfitting`): Selecting the best historical result from many strategy trials can select noise. The paper develops a probability-of-overfitting framework and combinatorially symmetric cross-validation to examine this selection problem. The MVP records its bounded search and forbids performance-based revision; it does not implement the paper's probability estimator or establish statistical significance.

Citation checks verify eligible IDs, exact summary excerpts, and limited lexical support. They are not a proof of entailment; human review of the source-to-claim relationship remains necessary.

## Independent skeptical review

Confidence: none

### Objections

- The provider did not return a completed structured design; no offline fallback was used.

### Limitations

- No new research conclusion is supported by this stopped run.

## Audit and memory

`audit.jsonl` records role events and gates. `research_journal.jsonl` retains locks and conclusions across runs. Both use append-only SHA-256 chains. They are local integrity checks, not externally authenticated evidence.
